I am sought by scholars, yet feared by despots.
I have no voice, yet I shape empires.
I have no hands, yet I craft what is known.
I have no feet, yet I travel beyond time.

The fool ignores me, the wise hoard me.
The desperate twist me, the patient seek me.
The frantic distort me, the measured reveal me.
The impulsive shun me, the deliberate embrace me.

You may call me Knowledge, Lore, Tomes, or Truth—
You may name me Magic, History, Myths, or Youth—
You may think I am Wisdom, Memory, Secrets, or Words—
You may believe I am Fables, Riddles, Echoes, or Birds—

Though these spoken are not my true name,
They are but echoes of a deeper flame

Tell me truly—what am I?
