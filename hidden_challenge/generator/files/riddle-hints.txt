I weave through words, yet make no sound.
In furrowed brows, I'm often found,
A light that blooms where questions stand,
What am I, in mind's vast land?

Seek not the blade nor wizard's flame,
Nor runes inscribed with ancient name,
In whispered winds and sage's lore,
My essence waits beyond the door.

No potion brewed in cauldron deep,
Nor spell from tome where secrets sleep,
In starlit gaze and council's care,
My presence lingers, pure and fair.

Turn from the tangible, the seen, the known,
To where the seeds of thought are sown,
A bridge of meaning, subtle, grand,
I rest within the mind's soft hand.

I'm not a prize you hold or see,
But grow through wonderâ€™s quiet plea,
A bond of hearts, a light unfurled,
I'm grasp of life within the world.

Seek not in shadows cast by flame,
Nor in the echo of a name,
I bloom where questions gently cease,
A quiet gift of inner peace.

Peer beyond the surface glare,
To wisdom's breath in stillness there,
No coin can buy, no force can bind,
I'm clarity within the mind.
