I am sought by scholars, yet feared by kings.
I have no voice, yet I shape empires.
I have no hands, yet I craft what is known.
I have no feet, yet I travel beyond time.

The fool ignores me, the wise hoard me.
The desperate twist me, the patient seek me.
The frantic distort me, the measured decipher me.
The impulsive shun me, the deliberate embrace me.

You may call me Knowledge, Lore, Tomes, or Truth—
You may name me Magic, History, Myths, or Youth—
You may think I am Wisdom, Memory, Secrets, or Words—
You may believe I am Fables, Riddles, Echoes, or Birds—
Yet none of these will turn the key.

Tell me truly—what am I?
